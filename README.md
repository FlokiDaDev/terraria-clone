A lightweight **Terraria-inspired clone** built in **C++23** using **OpenGL** and **GLFW**.
This project serves as a hands-on way to explore **graphics programming** and **game engine architecture**.

Inspired by [TheCherno‚Äôs Game Engine series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT&si=ZCR5-iKJd1afBkNo)

## ‚ú® Features
- Written in **modern C++23**
- Uses **OpenGL 4.6 CORE** via **GLAD**
- Project generation with **Premake5** for **Visual Studio 2022 (x64)**
- Clean project structure:
-  `engine` ‚Üí static library containing all core functionality + application entrypoint
-  `app` ‚Üí the actual Terraria-style game (links against `engine`)
- Designed for **‚ÄúShow All Files‚Äù** mode in Visual Studio for transparent project structure
- Multi-processor compilation enabled for faster builds
- Currently only supports Windows
- Built with eventual cross-platform support
---

## üì¶ Dependencies
Installed via [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) (`x64-windows-static` triplet recommended, modifications needed otherwise):
-  `glad[gl-api-46,gl-core]`
-  `glfw3`
-  `fmt`
-  `spdlog`
---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Vcpkg Setup
Recommended installation directory: `C:\dev\vcpkg`(change vcpkg_root in engine\premake5.lua & app\premake5.lua)
*Make sure the **VCPKG_ROOT** environment variable is set after installation (required by the provided Premake5 scripts).

```bat
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
cd vcpkg && bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
.\vcpkg.exe integrate install
```

## üìö Install required libraries
```bat
vcpkg install glad[gl-api-46,gl-core]:x64-windows-static
vcpkg install glfw3:x64-windows-static
vcpkg install spdlog:x64-windows-static
```
*Installing spdlog will automatically install fmt
  
## üìå Notes
- For glad, I used the vcpkg feature notation glad[gl-api-46,gl-core] which matches OpenGL 4.6 CORE profile.
- This assumes you already have VCPKG_ROOT correctly set in your environement variables (should be automatic when installing vcpkg)
